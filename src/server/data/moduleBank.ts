      "The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of statistics through illustrative use of statistical methods for solving applied problems. Emphasis will be placed on statistical reasoning, rather than derivation of theoretical details. Students will learn to solve common statistical problems using statistical software. This course is designed for students who wish to pursue a non-quantitative major at SMU. Students who intend to pursue a quantitative major should take its companion course, COR-STAT1203 Introduction to Statistical Theory.",

      "Computational Thinking equips students to tackle complex computational problems; it trains students to design solutions to solve those problems using a computer program. It draws upon concepts from mathematics and computer science – more precisely, discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithm design. This course will hone students’ analytical skills as they are challenged to think abstractly and computationally. Their minds will be open to the wonders of computing, as they go behind the scene to unravel the fundamental analytics that empower Google, consulting agencies and service companies. NOTE: To facilitate learning in this course, you are required to know and use programming. You are advised to pick up the Python programming language before the course, for instance by practising with online tutorials such as http://learnpython.org. By taking this course, students will: • discover the science of computing • model problems and learn practical problem-solving techniques to tackle complex computational problems (beyond what a spreadsheet is capable of solving) • apply problem-solving techniques to develop more elegant and efficient programs • learn to write programs to represent and manipulate with complex data objects • understand the challenge of scale, not only in dealing with large data sets, but also in appreciating the nature of computing and computability",

      "You give reasons for what you do and think every day. You argue. You often argue about things that matter to you. For example you might argue that you are the best candidate for promotion, about whether your company should invest in China, about the best way to help a friend or about what the right thing to do is in an ethical dilemma. The list is up to you. Increasingly in the 21st job market, you will need to think straight about any issue, even those unfamiliar to you. Recent surveys indicate that the most important skills employers are looking for are critical thinking and problem solving skills. We will teach you how to get better at reasoning and arguing in a way that can be applied to any subject matter.\n                Topics covered include evaluating arguments, constructing arguments, reconstructing arguments, formalizing arguments, clarifying meaning and identifying common mistakes in argument (fallacies). At the end of the course you should be able to (1) identify the structures of real-life arguments in order to decide if they are good or bad, and (2) argue logically about things that matter to you. This course is specifically designed to improve writing, thinking and oral presentation skills that are applicable to all areas of academic study and relevant to working life. Careful application in this course will deepen your capacity to critically evaluate everyday practical scenarios and will help you ‘think outside the box’.",

    description:
      "\n            The dynamic and fast changing nature of our world today is best described by VUCA, a term coined by the US Army War College. VUCA stands for Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous. The Arab Spring saw a change of government in countries like Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Once powerful countries in Europe are now fighting bankruptcy. The growth of the developing world which was taken for granted has begun to slow down. Even companies that were synonymous with their product categories just a few years ago are now no longer in existence. Kodak, the inventor of the digital camera had to wind up its operations, Borders, once the second largest US bookstore, has shut down due to their inability to evolve their business models with the changing times.\n\n            With such momentous changes happening in the world today, this course prepares the students to better understand the complexity and difficulties in reacting to the ambiguity inherent in those changes. This course helps students to understand the tensions in a given situation and how they need to think through a problem from multiple dimensions.\n\n            The course aims to give students an insight into the mega trends and forces that are impacting their world. We ask what are some of the causes of these trends and their business implications? What can future managers like themselves do about understanding these changing trends, and why they need to address, appreciate, adapt and attempt to manage these changes in their ecosystem? The course aims to introduce some basic VUCA concepts, in order to broaden their world view of management and nature of managing complex problems. The first half of the course introduces some of these trends, while the second half provides tools and possible frameworks to deal with the VUCA aspects that they will face in the future.",

The primary theoretical perspective taken is the stakeholder view of the firm which allows for close examination of apparently conflicting goals between different stakeholders' interests. Related frameworks and applications discussed in this course include corporate social responsibility, globalization, corporate governance, and public policy measures affecting business. The frameworks and issues discussed are critical to understanding how firms can be both financially successful and valuable to society, a concern which is increasingly influencing managerial decision-making. Illustrations and applications to the Singapore context as a small open economy will be discussed.",

      "Data Science has become one of the main drivers in transforming businesses and organizations. With proper data collection, preparation, analysis and modelling, insights can be achieved leading to better decision making and actions that create positive impact. Data analytics is divided into different levels namely, descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics and automated (or embedded) analytics. In this course, students will acquire practical skills in modelling and analysis to resolve business problems using software tools including Excel and Tableau. Knowing how to effectively use these tools to build models and analyse data to solve problems will add tremendous value in our students’ future professional career. This course’s primary focus is on using Excel spreadsheet as a platform to build mathematical models from scratch to represent business problems for detailed analysis. The use of such models to drive understanding and consensus towards generating insights and actions enhanced the assurance of execution success. With the data collected, data manipulation and transformation will be needed to prepare the data into useful forms for analysis. In terms of data analytics, this course will cover descriptive analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics, using both Excel and Tableau. In-class exercises would be used to present business problem modeling and analysis. Students would interactively develop the skills and experience to deal with open-ended questions, unclear assumptions and incomplete information. In addition to the individual assessments (take-home assignments and in-class quizzes), a group project will allow students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired to solve a business problem of their choice end-to-end where they will define the business questions, collect the necessary data, build the models, perform the data analytics, to draw insights and conclusions.",

      "\n            The overall objective of this module is to build and develop students' competency in leadership and teamwork skills. The course employs both a theoretical and an experiential learning approach with the aim of fulfilling the objectives as outlined below.\n\n            Students will gain knowledge and skills about leadership development and team-building skills based on theories, principles, concepts, application, exercises/class activities, self-assessments/instruments, and experiential learning.\n\n            Central to the course is the action-based and experiential Group Project Assignment that offers an opportunity for students to work in groups to collaborate with a non-profit organization or profit-based organization that upholds community development and/or corporate social responsibility or sustainability initiatives1, that is, they initiate and act as idea champions to contribute to community with a project of their own and approach beneficiaries along the way to amend or improve on their ideas. Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students.\n\n            As idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.\n\n            The outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:\n            (i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today's leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond.\n            (ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders' experiences.\n            (iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.\n            (iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see 'Reflection Essay' for details).\n            (v) Students will also fulfill other learning objectives that include cognitive and academic development as outlined below in the section, 'Learning Objectives'",

This course teaches students the basic ingredients of a business plan and a short ‘pitch’ for their ideas, yet shows the limitations of a static document in the changing marketplace.

The equity market is the dominant capital market and has been evolving and growing towards a more even mix of investor classes, with institutions such as investment funds, pension funds, insurance companies, corporates, sovereign wealth funds and Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFIIs) playing a more prominent role. The bond and derivatives markets are emerging as well and there is huge growth potential in the near future.\n\n                    This course is designed to offer a detailed analysis of China's capital markets, ranging from the overall assessment of the macro-economic environment and political context, to the detailed micro level study of the specific players, instruments, and individual transactions.

      "The core objective of the new SMU-X Transformative Leadership course is to nurture a new generation of young leaders motivated and capable of tackling intricate global and local challenges related to the nexus of ‘digital disruption, demographic change and diversity’ in an integrated, interdisciplinary fashion, providing the opportunity to integrate perceived differences between older and younger people in terms of values, communication priorities; age discrimination or the initiation of new types of social (‘digital’) behaviours transmitted from the plugged-in ‘Generation Z’ (born 1996 and after) to Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore. Embedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative solutions to make a positive impact on business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with an external SMU-X partner to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact. The successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, technology, etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will ‘stretch’ students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a ‘real’ difference ‘out there’ in both the social and business sectors. In terms of effective leader development, in particular, transformative leadership, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches.",

      "Contemporary governance illustrates a shift from a hierarchical, bureaucratic government to more collaborative, participative, and inclusive governance processes. Actors from public, private, and non-profit sectors collectively engage in policy decision-making to address complex social problems. Today's policy problems are described as ‘wicked problems’ that lack a set of clear definitions, causes and effects, and solutions. The wicked nature of the policy problems requires considering the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and innovative policy solutions. This course explores how governments and their stakeholders have experimented with new ideas, policies, governing processes, institutional arrangements, management tools, and technologies, to create public value and effect positive change. Using cases studies from a variety of policy areas and different countries, the course encourages students to understand the opportunities and challenges of public sector change initiatives including collaborative governance, e-governance, and coproduction. It prepares students to effectively address the multifaceted challenges of public policy and management through a variety of scholarly and practitioner publications, interactive and reflective exercises, and class discussions.",

      "This module is designed to introduce students to some key concepts within environmental history and STS studies, especially the impact and control of science and technology, with particular focus on the risks that these have posed to environmental sustainability and society in parts of Asia historically. Focusing on the history of the British Empire in Asia as a way of thinking around such issues, it uses imperial history as a lens into the development of ideas in environmental, medical and climatic science. It also considers the technological transformations that enabled and facilitated global imperial expansion. In so doing it considers imperialism’s role in environmental change in Asia; the transposition of scientific thought between West and East and, the evolution of environmentalism as a movement. It also seeks to promote interdisciplinary thinking about critical contemporary challenges by thinking through the complex historical interconnections of society, environment and science.",

      "This course introduces students to climate change, both within cities and globally, through a predominant STS perspective. Through in-class seminars incorporating digital platforms and field trips, students will examine the basic science underpinning present knowledge of climate change; explore the impacts of rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and rising sea levels on society; and discuss the role of technology and its management towards climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions and policies. Case studies from Singapore and the region will be presented, and special attention focused towards the latest research on (i.) socio-economic inequalities that heighten risks towards urban populations, and (ii.) how technological innovation evolves with applied nature-based solutions in reducing climate vulnerabilities. By the end of the course, the student should be cognisant on the potential of effective and practical management in reducing the impacts of environmental hazards to coupled human-environmental systems, and have the ability to assess solutions to adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts on important industries. Climate change will continue to wreck devastating social and economic impact in the years to come. The ability to understand and devise effective solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change across industries will be a valuable core skill enabling SMU graduates to maintain agility as they progress in their careers.",

      'The newest development in machine learning methods, such as Deep Neural Networks, brought about ubiquitous proclamations of a radical societal change. Amidst utopian visions of technological enthusiasts and dystopian scenarios advanced by the sceptics that proliferate in media, some basic questions about the aims and the tools of AI remain obscured. "Can Machines think ?” This class takes one of the central questions addressed to and by the proponents of the AI, artists, and philosophers as an entry point to consider the current emphasis on the transformative potential of machine learning from a historical perspective. Therefore, the course structure is mostly chronological. We will situate the field of AI in the long tradition of automata construction, as well as in the context of a cold war meta-discipline of cybernetics. We will read the original works of the founders of the field, such as Alan Turing and John McCarthy, to reconstruct the main lines of the intellectual development of the field as well as its paradoxes. We will also overview some of the main philosophical and ethical debates around the notions of “intelligence," “rationality," and “mind” in light of the computational technics for decision making. Finally, the course materials include a selection of science fiction novels, films, and short stories in order to discuss the notion of technological imagination as a link connecting public science, cultural production, and the formation of a scientific/engineering research programs.',

    description:
      "This course is a response to the increasing use of robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and digital technologies in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War I when the US army experimented with unmanned aerial torpedos. Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations. Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various functionalities of robotics, UAVs and digital innovations in order to critically assess these technologies and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of these novel technological developments. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors plus exposure to tech entrepreneurs and digital (corporate) innovation champions.",

Scientists have harnessed the power of cloning that promises miraculous cures through stem cell therapies. Many patients have pinned their hopes in the secrets of the BRCA genes to find that elusive cure for breast cancer. But what is biotechnology? How did the field emerge and for what purpose? What are the potentials and dangers of this new field? Who actually benefits from new biotechnologies? This course will explore these questions by examining the modern history of biotechnology and its embedding in a global, capitalist society. We will trace the political ideals, scientific developments, technological infrastructures, and new economic modes that made biotechnology possible.",

This course will consider several interrelated issues connected to climate change. Such issues include: What ethical challenges does climate change raise? Who has a right to what emission levels? How do we negotiate between collective and individual self-interests? What would constitute a just allocation of the burdens of climate change? What can economic analysis tell us (and not tell us) about climate change? In what ways does uncertainty challenge our ability to understand what we should do about climate change? Why might geoengineering be morally problematic? What are we individually and collectively required to do about climate change? What are our responsibilities toward future generations and the environment, and how do we take these into account? This course will examine the science, and look closely at the interplay of science and public policy. It will also look at the role of values in science. This course will approach these issues from a variety of perspectives.

      "The notion that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capacity to transform the way society operates has long been a part of popular culture. Androids have been dreaming of electric sheep since 1968, and Tom Cruise was already arresting pre-criminals in 2002. With the explosion of data available to governments and companies, and cloud computing platforms making supercomputing power widely available, science fiction and reality have never been closer. However, the true capabilities and limitations of AI are often poorly understood, as some predict doom, while others promise the moon. Modern AI techniques have the capacity to improve the way organisations operate, improving decision-making and increasing human and environmental wellbeing, but also carry the potential to cause harm if used irresponsibly or ignorantly. Accessible to technical and non-technical students alike, this course will introduce you to key techniques, showing how they can be flexibly applied to a range of problems, from using game theory to intercept wildlife poachers, through machine learning models for crime prediction, to risk-aware logistics scheduling. The course will guide you through the ethical implications of AI, considering the effects of biased data and the uncritical application of techniques. By the end of the course you will have a working understanding of the capacities and limitations of practical AI, equipping you to critically analyse new developments, and engage in responsible, informed decision-making in the workplace.",

      "A constitution is a country’s most important text: it creates State institutions, allocates powers and recognizes rights and responsibilities for those within its territory. More than that, constitutions express a state’s identity and provide the framework for all other laws and policies. This course will expose students to the challenges attendant on making constitutions work. At the same time, it will sensitise them to the extent to which the wider social, political and economic context and a country’s underlying culture affect the implementation of constitutional rules and values. Evergreens like the separation of powers, constitutional enforcement and dilemmas in ensuring equality and dignity will be explored through comparative study of experiences in a diverse range of jurisdictions. Instead of exploring models and constitutional solutions in the abstract, the course invites students to explore the practical impact and outcomes particular constitutional models and ideas produce in everyday life. To that end, we will amongst others compare the constitutional responses that different countries provide to contemporary challenges such as how to ensure effective public participation in governance without encouraging populism; the pervasiveness of migration for our understanding of citizenship and its entitlements; ensuring that everyone is treated equally while respecting individual autonomy and life choices; the role of technology in public life and the implications for privacy and free speech; and the role of a constitution in fostering economic development.",

In this pursuit, it analyses beliefs and ideas, products of artistic nature, as well as the objects and experiences of everyday life, such as clothing or cuisine. Culture also encompasses attitudes, values, assumptions and prejudices, and the rituals and practices that express them. In this regard, our current thoughts and acts have an ancestry which cultural history can illuminate and critically examine. This course explores fundamental moments in the history of Europe: from the foundations in Greece and Rome, through the alliances, conflicts and revolutions that transformed it, and key periods such as the Enlightenment and Modernism, that significantly shaped it. They all help understand the complexities of today's Europe, from the challenges in cultural integration to Brexit. Through lectures, key readings, analyses of case studies and research projects, this course broadens understanding of Europe. By establishing linkages between history, socio-political and economic contexts, religion, and art forms, it reveals crucial intersections to comprehend the landmarks of the cultural history of Europe.",

      "Nations have long sought to evoke loyalty and personal attachment, while in turn providing those living within it with a collective experience and common destiny. The potent force of the nation as a cognitive idea is at the heart of this course, which conceives of the making of a nation as an ongoing work in progress in which everyone has a stake. The central question that we will investigate concerns the reciprocal influences between the nation, its institutional manifestations and ‘the people’. How do ‘the people’ shape institutions and fashion a nation on a daily basis and vice versa?\n\n                To explore these relationships, the course is structured around three themes: prerequisites, process and practice. The first theme provides the general conceptual framework through a series of brief discussions of what a nation is, how it relates to a state and to a ‘people’. The second theme is devoted to what is often seen as the quintessential nation-building moment: the formal drafting of a constitution. We will consider the choice of language in that text to harness the people’s fidelity to the budding nation as well as the respective roles played by the elites and ordinary citizens during the constitution-process. For the third theme, we will probe the lived reality of how the nation constitutes itself every day through its people, from the elites who claim to speak on behalf of the nation in formal rule-making to the personification of the nation in image, song and icon to the architectural design of state institutions and public spaces and the wearing of folk costumes or traditional outfits that seek to give expression to the identity of the nation.\n\n                Our explorations will feature the experiences of a diverse range of nations located within and outside Asia. These will provide the backdrop against which the Singapore story will be considered, thereby allowing students to interrogate the familiar domestic narrative of nation-building from a comparative angle. The approach taken will be practically grounded and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from law, political theory, history, linguistics, architecture and the arts. To do so effectively, the course will be team-taught by two instructors with complementary disciplinary backgrounds.\n                ",

Next, we will explore contemporary topics and issues in Southeast Asia such as religion and violence, gender, race, class, development, and globalization.

In this course, we explore the big question of whether these two concepts – the global and the local – are really opposites and whether it is possible to find a home in a world that is global. These explorations will transpire through analysis and discussion of readings drawn from business, scientific, legal, philosophical, and aesthetic sources illuminating the intersections of the global and local. By the end of the course, students will be expected to able to articulate their responses to whether they can find home in a globalized world by integrating the course material with their own personal experiences. This course should be of special interest to students embarking on endeavours that will take them far from home, as one objective will be for them to articulate what ‘home’ is.",

Lessons will evolve along topics such as self-introduction, family and home, neighborhood, daily activities, shopping, holiday activities, and Japanese culture will be incorporated in each lesson. This course is the equivalent of CEFR A1 level. Japanese scripts (Hiragana and Katakana) is used throughout the course, and basic Kanji readings would also be introduced. ",

    description:
      "Law and legal systems are ubiquitous in modern societies. As Kant noted, law takes away man’s “savage (lawless) freedom” to return to him a more limited freedom under the law. But what exactly is law? How is law related to justice? Is law merely a power phenomenon? Is law merely politics? Is the monopolization of coercive force by the state justified?\n\n                This course provides students with the opportunity to think about law’s nature and its role in society. We will examine these questions through accounts of law offered by legal positivists and natural law theorists, and challenges posed by alternative critical accounts of American legal realism and critical legal studies. How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? Are the accounts rooted in particular historical contexts or cultures, or are they as relevant today or within our society? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the present practice of law? Do the accounts have something to say about how we, as lawyers or citizenry, can harness law’s potential as a tool for transforming society?\n\n                Through this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice. Students will also be encouraged to relate the theories studied to current contexts. The course's focus is on critique of ideas and not mere description of doctrine. The methods of assessment will be intentionally geared towards facilitating critical thought. This course encourages students to formulate their own theses about law and justice, and meaningfully understand the role they can play – as lawyers and as citizens – in the legal process.",

    description:
      "Humans have been making war and peace throughout their recorded history. We can be fairly certain this was the case well before civilization emerged. Conflicts always seem to erupt over scarce resources, contentious values and ideas, fissures in relationships, fault-lines in societies, the list goes on. And, intertwined with these conflicts are efforts to end violence, to heal wounds and reconcile, to share resources, to create or re-establish a semblance of harmony between peoples. Most of all will perceive these human activities as binary opposites, as mutually exclusive, leading us to invest particular meanings in each to distinguish them further from each other. Indeed, thanks to influences from culture, media, from our communities, families and leaders, we typically perceive war and peace as suffering versus happiness, action not stillness, a zone of masculine combat versus one of safety for women and children, and much more. These ingrained perceptions shape our decisions, actions and relationships in fundamental ways, determining our behavior and experiences in all spaces and times, whether we have construed them to be in the context of war, peace, and anything beyond or in-between. Since our views of war and peace are so fundamental to our life experience, this course asks us for a deeper engagement of our prior knowledge.\n                    Through critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of war and peace in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others? We investigate how our notions of war and peace contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about belonging, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of war and peace; reflect on how they debate the purposes of war-making and peace-making; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for the spoils of both war and peace. Also, we will study how our knowledge of war and peace may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives.",

      "In this course, we introduce students to the economic way of thinking about societal issues. We use the themes of incentives and empiricism to illustrate the power of simple economic ideas, and their ability to explain, predict, and improve what happens in the world. The course will examine how market activities are shaped by both the private and public sector. It will allow students to appreciate how free markets and government policies affect society, creating winners and losers, and to understand the societal trade-offs implicated in an economy. The course will also examine debates on the importance of social institutions in contributing to economic growth, and on economic policies surrounding the world financial crisis. Two topics related to Growth in Asia will be covered in the course.",

      "Big Questions will take a theme every year, or a major global challenge broadly defined as a thesis and its (seeming) antithesis. Big Questions will introduce students to the challenging ethical, theoretical, and operational debates that attend to these themes. Students in any given year will be able to choose from a menu of sub-themes, each using a different disciplinary lens and focusing on different aspects of the theme, while also sharing a canon of readings and attending public lectures dedicated to the year's theme for a shared intellectual experience. The themes may include Happiness and Suffering, Global and Local, Robots and Humans, Wealth and Poverty, War and Peace, amongst others.",

      "The objective of the Course is to raise the awareness of students with regard to the multi-faceted ethical and social responsibility issues faced by businesses and corporate executives, whether individuals or organisations. The initial part of the Course will focus on critiquing various ethical and social theories developed by philosophers, economists, sociologists, management theorists and others. Both Western and non-Western theories will be examined. The Course also aims at developing the moral reasoning skills of students and applying them to the specific problems and dilemmas faced by individuals and organisations in the business and corporate world.",

      "We begin our adventure by exploring the essential elements of Computing Systems — hardware, software, and network technologies — through a series of challenging yet fun learning activities. We grow our coding skills by building a networked, distributed computing system: starting with physical computing devices that unite the cyber and physical realms, we add fundamental networking capabilities for devices to exchange information and form networks, and finally integrate the system into the cloud. Equipped with newfound skills and knowledge, we unleash our creative energies, our youthful idealism, and our capacity to dream, by designing visionary technology to conquer a real-world societal challenge. This is a journey into the unknown. Yet, a still, small voice deep within us compels us: Courage! Do not be afraid! Put out into the deepest oceans and brave the stormiest seas! Let down your nets for an awesome catch! The adventure reaches its peak at the project showcase, where we witness the work of human hands come to fruition, leaving us inspired to reflect deeply and broadly about how we, as global citizens, can harness the power of Computing Systems as a potent force in the service of humanity.",

      "Web applications are commonly used today by governments, enterprises, and even individuals to provide information, market products, etc. Ability to create web applications is thus a crucial skill for graduates in Information Systems. This course is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skill to develop well-styled database-driven web applications. In the early weeks of the course, students would be introduced to web concepts and trained to build static web pages using HTML. Next, students will be taught on how to program dynamic web applications using PHP. Programming concepts that students have learned in Introduction to Programming (IS111) will be revisited (using PHP as the programming language), expanded, and used to allow students to program web applications that can adapt based on user inputs. After basic PHP programming has been introduced, students will then be taught on how they can connect to a database to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data. They can then design dynamic web pages that present different contents reflecting contents stored in a database as well as allow users to modify database contents through the webpages. In the final weeks of the course, students will be introduced to more advanced PHP concepts including session management to allow for stateful interactive information exchange between users and a web application.",

In the introductory weeks of the course, the students will revisit HTML and server-side programming (PHP) concepts learnt in IS113. Then, the students will learn the concept of “Styling” the web pages. The students will learn a style sheet language called cascading style sheets (CSS) and learn how to separate the content and presentation of web pages, how to control web page layout, colors and fonts, how to bring multiple styles into a web page, how to control the layout of multiple web pages efficiently, etc. Next, the students will learn the concept of adding responsive behaviors to web pages to enhance the user experience. The students will learn a client-side programming language called JavaScript to make ordinary web elements like input boxes, buttons, forms, tables, menus interactive and animated. Furthermore, they will learn how to connect to API gateways and process data from external sources like RESTful web services so that they can build practical applications. In the latter weeks of the course, the students will be introduced to programming with frameworks. The students will learn how to use frameworks to build complex web applications in an efficient, scalable manner. More specifically, the students will be introduced to Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework for developing responsive website and introduced to Vue, a progressive JavaScript framework for building rich user interfaces.",

      "With the emergence of new technologies and evolution of existing ones, organizations are changing the way they build enterprise solutions. Rather than build monolithic applications, the current emphasis is on building solutions by leveraging existing functionality exposed as services. This approach to composing solutions using services follows the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm, where applications are structured as a collection of loosely coupled services. In this course students will learn how to design and implement enterprise solutions using SOA using suitable tools. The course will cover topics such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), microservices architecture (MSA), web services, JSON/XML, cloud computing, and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).",

      "Cloud computing gain fast development within the past 15 years and continue penetrating to many aspects of our daily lives. It provides strong and reliable support for all kinds of information systems in various industries. It also greatly reduces the go-to-market time for high-tech start-up companies. Although many people are using cloud in their daily work, but few of them have structural understanding on how cloud functions. With more and more fancy features incorporated in Cloud, it seems difficult for beginners to understand their relations and apply them to real world problems. This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concept and basic structure of cloud computing. The topics covered include basic cloud concept, typical business and technical requirements on cloud infrastructure, basic building blocks for an cloud solution, and how to manage reliability and incident using cloud tools. All topics are designed based on actual commercial usage pattern to support real business requirements. Computing theory and mathematical analysis are included at a minimally needed level. Exercising and integration of knowledge learnt will be covered through assignments, labs, and a demonstrative project for real world problems. After this course, students are expected to gain a structural concept of how cloud operates and how to manipulate cloud resources to support information system and business needs. The principles and techniques learnt in this course will help students understand the common core structure of various commercial cloud platforms and how to go deeper to a specific function. With this foundation, students can easily build up their knowledge of a chosen commercial cloud on a systematic way using online resources.",
