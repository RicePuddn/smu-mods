Founded on the principles of giving and professional excellence, our club envisions an SMU where future generations are consistently better than the last. In each circle, each mentee will be able to grow under the guidance of a mentor, seeking advice in areas such as academics and career. This mentorship journey will be the start of a long lasting and symbiotic friendship, where both the mentor and mentee will learn together. Mentees and mentors will also have the opportunity to interact with other members from the Circle and as well as our alumni. With each Circle, our mentoring reach expands and new bonds are formed. We hope that through this endeavour, SMU can become a nexus for mentorship. The Mentoring Circle is proudly supported by the SMU Office of Alumni Relations.`,

      description: "Daoists have a deep admiration and close connection to nature. Among the various modern schools of ecology, they resonate most with Deep Ecology: developed by the Norwegian thinker Arne Naess, it focuses on the system of environmental cooperation as a whole and can be described as a form of biospherical egalitarianism or organic holism. Daoists accordingly integrate all natural features, plants and animals, in a comprehensive existentialism. They see everything as interconnected in a natural pattern of complementarity, described in terms of yin and yang. In contrast to the prevailing view of nature in the Western world, determined by the Biblical injunction in Genesis that 'man have dominion over every creeping thing' on earth, Daoists propose to merge with the flow of Dao, that is, return to organic harmony, a stable, homeostatic order.",
